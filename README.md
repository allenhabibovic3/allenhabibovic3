- ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone!, I am Allen Habibovic, 24 year old from Chicago specializing in data analytics, data science, and deep learning. I am currently finishing my 
Masters degree in Computer Science at Northeastern Illinois University. 

  I have always been interested with computers and working with them from a young age. I started learning basic web development skills in high school and this grew  
into a tremendous passion for solving problems with computer science. To me, it is truly remarkable how computing has evolved into something so powerful and
applicable to everyone in their daily lives. I have experience primarily with Java and Python programming languages. I began to focus my studies in the fields of
data science, data analytics, and deep learning. We use big data to keep solving problems and creating new innovations that change the world. 

  Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with text data more and specifically in the realm of NLP(Natural Language Processing). My masters project is detecting how
polarized a topic currently is using Tweets from Twitter. I am also completing my capstone project to add to my portfolio to showcase my knowledge particulary learned
from the Google Data Analytics Certification. 

  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on really anthing involving data analytics and machine learning. It would be fun to work with someone on a project or a problem statement.
Would be a great oppurtunity to share ideas and learn new techniques from the online community.
